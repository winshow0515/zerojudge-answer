# ZeroJudge Practice Problems

This repository contains my solutions to various programming problems from [ZeroJudge](https://zerojudge.tw/), which I use to practice for algorithmic competitions.

## What I'm Learning

Through solving these problems, I'm practicing:

- Basic coding techniques and problem-solving skills  
- Common algorithms such as:
  - **Dynamic Programming**
  - **Greedy Algorithms**
  - **Search Algorithms** (e.g. BFS, DFS)
- Fundamental data structures including:
  - **Stack**
  - **Queue**
  - **Tree**
  - **Graph**

These problems help me strengthen my understanding of algorithms, data structures, and efficient coding practices.

## Language

Most of the solutions are written in **Python**.
